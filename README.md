# Youtube video download app

<h2>Python Learning Project | An application was developed that downloads videos from YouTube after inserting the link by the user.</h2>

<h3>Goals to elaborate:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access the video and display its information</li>
<li>When downloading, you must inform the name of the video and the location where it is being stored locally.</li>
<li>In videos that enable subtitles, download the subtitles automatically, export them in a text file together with the video, storing them in the same folder.</li>
